## Data Science Masterâ€™s Student | MIT Applied Data Science Graduate | Psychology B.Sc. 
Iâ€™m a Data Science Masterâ€™s student at TU Vienna with a background in psychology and applied AI, passionate about bridging human behavior and machine intelligence through projects in machine learning, predictive modeling, and data storytelling â€” from malaria detection at MIT to economic forecasting.
## Projects
### Nowcasting Economic Indicators | University of Vienna
Endorsed by Berenberg Bank and UBS building predictive models combining
macroeconomic indicators and high-frequency data (Google Trends, financial time
series, weather data)
Implementing MIDAS regression and Bayesian dynamic factor models to improve
short-term forecasting accuracy
### Malaria Detection using Deep Learning | MIT Capstone Project
Built an architecture capable of detecting malaria parasites in blood cell images
with 98% accuracy
Optimized for low-resource hardware, enabling real-world applicability in
developing countries 
Presented findings in Applied Data Science Program

### Mindfulness and Sleep Research | Bachelor Thesis, University of Vienna
Investigated the relationship between trait mindfulness, emotion regulation, and
sleep quality in a sample of 497 participants
Conducted mediation analyses using structural equation modeling; results support
the mediating effect of depressive symptoms.
Suggested practical implications for Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) in
improving public health
### RAG Pipline for Estimating ESG Score for Companys by Project Reports | University of Vienna
Established a Pipline for either inputting PDFs manually or via REST APIs to estimate a ESG Score of a Company or Team.
